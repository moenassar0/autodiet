> This design was first made on Figma as wireframes then formed into mockups. You will see the design of the website changing along the way as better color palettes and design patterns were used. First let's see the mockups:

Let us briefly mention the tech stack and technologies the application used:

- This application was built using the ReactJS library. ReactJS [React](https://www.reactjs.org) helps us move from the daunting task of writing vanilla JavaScript by offering its rich library that builds single page applications using components.
- For the backend we used the framework built for web artisans [Laravel](https://laravel.com). Laravel was used purely for the api calls and database connection. For the database we used MySQL.
- Firebase was also used as part of our backend. Firebase helped the application send push notifications to the user as well as help build our chatting system using real-time databases.
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
